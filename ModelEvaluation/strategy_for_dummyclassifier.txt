Stratified:
Stratified makes prodictions that are proportional to the training set's target vector's class proportions.
Example:
If 20% of the observations in the training data are women, then DummyClassifier will predict women 20% of the time.

Uniform:
Uniform will grnerate predictions uniformly at random between the different classes.
Example:
If 20% of the observations in the traning data are women and 80% are men, uniform will produce predictions that are 50% women and 50% men.
